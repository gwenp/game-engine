CPP plugin system
------------------

This is a conceptual demo for a plugin system done for a team group at uni, that I tweaked a bit to make it more usable. It demonstrate the ability to lazy load some portions of your code in C++, thus having a highly extensible applications.

However, this system suffers of limitations :

	- Plugins highly depends on operating systems due to different dynamic linking APIs throughout different existing OS
	- Plugins might also not work if compiled with different compilers (or even different versions of them) because the layout of the vtable is sadly not a standard...


If you have a good proposal to make it (even a little) more cross platform or less limited in any way,  don't hesitate to contact me!
